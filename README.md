# Depression Detection Project

## 📝 Introduction

Depression is a growing concern among students and can significantly
affect their academic performance, social life, and overall well-being.
This project focuses on detecting depression levels in students using
the **Student Depression Dataset**. By applying **data preprocessing,
exploratory analysis, and machine learning models**, the notebook aims
to uncover patterns and provide predictive insights that can help in
early detection and support.

## 📊 Dataset

-   **File used**: `Student Depression Dataset.csv`\
-   Contains information about students' **profession, academic
    performance, and depression status**.\
-   Target variable: **`Depression`** .

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed and the following libraries
available:

``` bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🔑 Methods Used

-   **Data Preprocessing**: Handling null values, converting categorical
    data with One-Hot Encoding.\
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Countplots, correlations, and
    visualizations.\
-   **Machine Learning Models**: Various classifiers (e.g., Logistic
    Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Adaboost,LIME,SHAP
    ## 📈 Results

-   Shows **class distribution** of depression.\
-   Model evaluation with **accuracy and performance metrics**.\
-   Helps understand which features affect student depression the most.

## 📌 Future Improvements

-   Use **larger and more diverse datasets**.\
-   Apply **deep learning models** for better accuracy.\
-   Build a **web app or dashboard** for real-time prediction.
